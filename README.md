Friends Generator

This project aims to build a tool to generate new sequences of famous US TV show 'Friends'. It is based on a decoder-only transformer that was build from scratch using PyTorch. It is working at a character level (tokenization).
Due to a very light training and a poor tokenization-embedding level the model only manages to produce scipt-like text and struggles to produce actual sentences.
